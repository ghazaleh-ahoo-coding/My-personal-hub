<h1>About Me:</h1> 
  <!-- add two paragraphs -->
  <main>
    <p>My name is Ghazaleh Azimi, and I’m from the historic city of Herat, Afghanistan. 
      I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree at
      the American University of Afghanistan (AUAF), where I am deepening my knowledge and skills in both
      language and technology. With a strong passion for education, communication, and personal growth,
      I strive to make a meaningful impact through everything I do.</p>
    <p>I have a deep love for traveling and adventure, and
      I enjoy capturing beautiful moments through photography. 
      One of my biggest dreams is to blend my creative side with my technical skills. 
      The first project I plan to create after learning web development is a personal website called Pixel, 
      where I will showcase my recent photos of nature, landscapes, and life’s special moments.</p>
    <p>I am particularly drawn to the intersection of education and technology, 
      and I am eager to explore how these fields can intersect and complement each other. 
      Looking ahead, my goal is to become a dynamic professional who bridges the gap between education and technology. 
      I aim to further develop my expertise in web development, project management, and teaching. 
      Whether it’s through empowering students, building digital solutions, 
      or contributing to community projects, I hope to play a key role in shaping a brighter and more connected future.</p>
